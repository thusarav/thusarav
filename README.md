## 💡 About Me

- 🎓 Second-year IT undergraduate passionate about building real-world solutions  
- 🐧 Linux-first mindset — love tinkering, optimizing, and breaking things (then fixing with dignity)  
- ⚙️ Currently exploring **DevOps**, **AWS/Azure**, **CI/CD pipelines**, and **Containerization**  
- 🧠 Actively learning **MERN**, **Docker**, **GitHub Actions**, and **software architecture**  
- 🔍 Always curious… maybe a polymath in progress 😉

- 🧩 Fun fact: I believe every good bug deserves its own detective arc
